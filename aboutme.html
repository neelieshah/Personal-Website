      Hi! My name is Neelie Shah. Right now I'm a Sophomore at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute,
      Indiana. Currently, I'm working towards getting a double major in Computer Science and Software Engineering with
      a minor in Data Science. While I love CS and its related fields, I also love being involved in all sorts of other
      things! On campus, I am involved in the <a href="#SASA" id="highlightword">South Asian Student Alliance</a>, the
      <a href="#SGA" id="highlightword">Student Government Association</a>,
      and my sorority, <a href="#CHIO" id="highlightword">Chi Omega</a>. While I'm not on campus, I enjoy <a
        href="#TRAVEL" id="highlightword">traveling</a>, <a href="#BAKEnCOOK" id="highlightword">cooking</a>, and <a
        href="#BAKEnCOOK" id="highlightword">baking</a>! Scroll below or click any of the dotted links to see more :)
